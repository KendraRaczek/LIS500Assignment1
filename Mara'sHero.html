    <h1>Susan Wojcicki</h1>
    
    <h5 style="padding-top:14px; ">Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of Youtube, is a former Google employee who pursued her undergraduate at Harvard, attended UC Santa Cruz for her masters and UCLA for her MBA. With her passion for gender equality, Wojcicki largely emphasizes including more women in the future of the tech world.</h5>
        
    <p style="color:#757575;">Before working as an early employee for Google, specifically the sixteenth individual to join the team, Wojcicki rented out her garage to two Stanford doctoral students to help pay off her mortgage. These students were Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the minds behind the largest search engine to come about, Google. Wojcicki joined the team in 1999 as the company’s first marketing manager and many made great additions to the company.</p>

    <p style="color:#757575;">In 2014, Wojcicki became the CEO of YouTube. Initially, it was her who convinced Page and Brin to purchase YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006. During her first year as CEO, she also went on maternity leave for her fifth child and decided to advocate maternity-leave benefits for women in the United States. Her positive stance on maternity-leave may potentially subside from when she joined Google four months pregnant in 1999, becoming the first Google employee to go on maternity leave.</p>

    <h1 style="font-family:Oswald">Wojcicki's Main Projects</h1>

    <h5 style="padding-top:14px;">Working at both Google and YouTube, Wojcicki has made very influential company additions that greatly impacted the companies to allow for massive company growth. Additionally, she uses her status and power to advocate gender equality in the tech world.</h5>
              
    <p style="color:#757575;">
        In starting her new marketing position at Google, one of Wojcicki’s first projects involved recreating the Google logo for holiday and event purposes. As we know today, this logo customization, typically on the daily, has greatly continued on and been a popular feature for users ever since. 
        </p>  
        <p style="color:#757575;">
            In addition to the personalization of the logo, Wojcicki largely worked with Google’s advertising ability by suggesting the idea for what is now considered AdSense. Since her idea in 2003, more than 11 million websites use AdSense. By 2017, the product generated over $95 billion in ad revenue. 
        </p>
        <p style="color:#757575;">
            Throughout her career, Wojcicki worked to spread awareness about closing the gender gap in the technology industry. From writing articles, publishing editorials, attending talk shows and using her leadership and success as an example, Wojcicki emphasizes the importance of having an equal representation of males and females in the future of ever-changing and dominant technological ideas. Additionally, Wojcicki inspires famous YouTube personalities to also address the gender gap and other issues concerning race and gender inequalities.
        </p>

        <p style="color:#757575;">
            Through her work, Wojcicki proves it does not take being a man in Silicon Valley to provide great leadership and be the CEO of a large, successful company. Additionally, her genuine work-life balance allows her career to work well and accommodate her family life, from leaving working for periods of time to have children, as well as raising them. Wojcicki serves as a positive example to all women, not solely women in the tech world, but women attempting to get past gender inequalities in the workforce as a whole. “Tech is an incredible force that will change our world in ways we cannot anticipate. If that force is only 20 percent to 30 percent women, that is a problem,” Wojcicki shared with Forbes in 2018.
